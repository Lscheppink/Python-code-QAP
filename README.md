Python code for Bachelor Thesis about QAP.

The main file is qap.py. In this file, an QAP instance from QAPLIB is imported (as a .dat file) and the LP bounds for 6 LP relaxations are calculated. At the end of the file, a .json file is created containing the results of the QAP instance. This file imports the functions from the CalculateALU.py file which are used to precalculate the a, l and u values.
